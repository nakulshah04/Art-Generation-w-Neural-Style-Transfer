# Art-Generation-w-Neural-Style-Transfer
This is a personal project from DeepLearning.AI's [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/deep-learning-specialization/) Course#4: Convolutional Neural Networks

Neural style transfer (NST) is a cool AI technique that lets you combine the look of two images into one. Imagine taking a photo and making it look like a famous painting! It employs two Ingredients:
- Content Image (C): This is the picture you want to keep the basic structure of. Think of it as the sketch or outline.
- Style Image (S): This is the image that provides the artistic flair. It could be a painting, a drawing, or even another photograph with a unique style.

The model combines these two images to form a third generated (G) image, which is a fine blend of the content and style images.
